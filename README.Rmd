This repository contains example data visualisations for Week 11's assignment in R in 3 Months.

## Different types of chart

In Week 11 David shows several different types of chart and how it's a good idea to experiment with alternative geoms.

We've used geom_line() a few times to visualise time series:

```{r}
bechdel_pass_rate_over_time <- bechdel %>%
  filter(year >= 1984) %>% 
  select(year, binary) %>% 
  count(year, binary) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  mutate(percent_n = n / sum(n))


bechdel_pass_rate_over_time %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = percent_n,
             color = binary)) +
  geom_line()

```

Alternatively, we could create a filled area chart with scale_area(). I've also used the {ggtext} package to give a more meaningful title to the chart:

```{r}
bechdel_pass_rate_over_time %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = percent_n,
             fill = binary)) +
  geom_area(position = "stack") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("FAIL" = "#A61C1B", "PASS" = "#6689F0")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  labs(title = "Over time the percentage of movies <span style='color:#6689F0'>passing the Bechdel test</span> is increasing",
       y = "Percentage of movies released",
       subtitle = "Data from fivethiryeight::bechdel") +
  theme(plot.title = element_markdown())
```

With a little bit of fine tuning we can tidy up this chart even further:

```{r}
bechdel_pass_rate_over_time %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             # ymax = percent_n,
             # ymin = 0,
             y = percent_n,
             fill = binary)) +
  geom_area(position = "stack") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("FAIL" = "#A61C1B", "PASS" = "#6689F0")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(),
                     expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  labs(title = "Over time the percentage of movies <span style='color:#6689F0'>passing the Bechdel test</span> is increasing",
       y = "Percentage of movies released",
       subtitle = "Data from fivethiryeight::bechdel") +
  theme(plot.title = element_markdown())
```



## Tables

David introduced the {gt} packages for creating good looking tables. Here's an example visualising the most popular episodes from the reboot of Dr. Who:

```{r}
dr_who_episodes <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-11-23/episodes.csv')

most_popular_by_season <- dr_who_episodes %>% 
  select(season_number, episode_title, uk_viewers) %>% 
  mutate(uk_viewers = 1E6 * uk_viewers) %>% 
  arrange(season_number) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(season_number) %>% 
  filter(uk_viewers == max(uk_viewers)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(growth = (uk_viewers - lag(uk_viewers)) / uk_viewers)

most_popular_by_season %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  cols_label(season_number = "Season",
             episode_title = "Episode Title",
             uk_viewers = "UK Viewers (Millions)",
             growth = "Growth (compared to previous season)") %>% 
  fmt_number(columns = uk_viewers,
             suffixing = TRUE) %>% 
  fmt_percent(growth) %>% 
  fmt_missing(columns = growth,
              missing_text = "") %>% 
  tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "red"),
    locations = cells_body(
    columns = growth,
    rows = growth < 0
  ))
```

## Annotation

Annotations can really help add story/explanations to your charts. In the line chart below I've used geom_vline() and annotate() to clearly identify the COVID-19 pandemic. I've also used {ggtext} to highlight an interesting feature of the data:

```{r, out.width='800px'}
busiest_us_airports <- read_csv("data/busiest-us-airports.csv")


min_passengers <- min(busiest_us_airports$passengers)
max_passengers <- max(busiest_us_airports$passengers)
annotation_y_center <- min_passengers + (max_passengers - min_passengers) / 2         

colors_airports <- c("Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport" = "#B0241F",
                     "Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport" = "#7F8D3C",
                     "Denver International Airport" = "#F97A1D",
                     "O'Hare International Airport" = "#F1B43A",
                     "Los Angeles International Airport" = "#DE7769")

busiest_us_airports %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = passengers,
             color = airport)) +
  geom_line(key_glyph = "timeseries") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2020) +
  annotate("text",
           x = 2020 + 0.2,
           y = annotation_y_center,
           label = "2020 Coronavirus Pandemic",
           angle = 90
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1E-6,
                                                    suffix = " Million")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = colors_airports,
                     name = "") +
  labs(y = "Total passengers",
       title = "The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically affected passenger numbers amongst the top 5 busiest US airports.",
       subtitle = "<span style='color:#7F8D3C'>Dallas Airport</span> is the only airport to have increased passenger in 2020,") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_markdown())
```

With a little bit more effort and the {ggrepel} package we can add labels to either end of the lines. Please note that I used ggsave() to fully control the dimensions of the chart and then it's been inserted into the RMarkdown output with knitr::include_graphics()

```{r, out.width='800px'}
gg_busiest_airport <- busiest_us_airports %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = passengers,
             color = airport)) +
  geom_line(key_glyph = "timeseries") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2020) +
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = ifelse(year == 2009, scales::number(passengers, 
                                                                   scale = 1E-6, 
                                                                   suffix = "M",
                                                                   accuracy = 1), "")),
                   nudge_x = -0.5,
                   segment.color = 'transparent',
                   size = 2,
                   show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = ifelse(year == 2020, scales::number(passengers, 
                                                                   scale = 1E-6, 
                                                                   suffix = "M",
                                                                   accuracy = 1), "")),
                   nudge_x = 0.1,
                   segment.color = 'transparent',
                   size = 3,
                   show.legend = FALSE) +
  annotate("text",
           x = 2020 + 0.1,
           y = 50E6,
           label = "2020 Coronavirus Pandemic",
           angle = 90,
           size = 3
           ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1E-6,
                                                    suffix = " Million")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(busiest_us_airports$year)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = colors_airports,
                     labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 20),
                     name = "") +
  labs(y = "Total passengers",
       title = "The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically affected passenger numbers amongst the top 5 busiest US airports.",
       subtitle = "<span style='color:#7F8D3C'>Dallas Airport</span> is the only airport to have increased passenger in 2020,") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 10) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_markdown(),
        legend.position = "bottom")

ggsave("README_files/images/gg_busiest_airport.png",
       gg_busiest_airport,
       width = 10,
       height = 5)

knitr::include_graphics("README_files/images/gg_busiest_airport.png")
